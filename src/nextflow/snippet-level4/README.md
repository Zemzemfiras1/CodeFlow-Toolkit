# Snippet Level 4 — Process Directives & Configuration

This level covers **process directives** and how to control execution:

- **1-failprocess-directives-.nf** → Handle failing processes.
- **2-retry-directives.nf** → Retry failed processes automatically.
- **3-time-directives.nf** → Set time limits for processes.
- **4-time-Config-directives.nf** → Control timeouts via config.
- **5-when-directives.nf** → Run processes conditionally.
- **6-StoreDir-directives.nf** → Use `storeDir` for caching results.
- **7-directives.nf** → Miscellaneous directive examples.
- **conf/base.config** → Base configuration file.
- **nextflow.config** → Config for this level.
- **outputDir/qc_report.html** → Example process output.

> ⚠️ **Note:** These pipelines are simplified examples for **teaching purposes**.

➡️ Use this level to learn how to **fine-tune processes**, handle failures, and configure resources.
