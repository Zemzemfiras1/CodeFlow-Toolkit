# Snippet Level 2 — Channels and Inputs

This level focuses on **data channels** and how to provide input to workflows:

- **1-fromFilePairs.nf** → Create channels from paired files (e.g., R1/R2 FASTQ).
- **2-fromPath.nf** → Create channels from files in a path.
- **3-fromPathcsv.nf** → Load data from a CSV file into channels.
- **samples.csv** → Example metadata file.
- **workshopEnv.yml** → Example Conda environment.
- **nextflow.config** → Configuration for this level.

> ⚠️ **Note:** These pipelines are simplified examples for **teaching purposes**.

➡️ Use this level to understand how Nextflow channels work and how to feed data into workflows.
