# Snippet Level 5 — Multi-Process Workflows & Containers

This level introduces **workflows with multiple processes** and **container execution**:

- **5-multiplesProcesses.nf** → Example with several processes chained together.
- **6-containers.nf** → Run processes inside Docker or Singularity containers.
- **7-containers.nf** → Another containerized workflow.
- **nextflow.config** → Configuration for this level.

> ⚠️ **Note:** These pipelines are simplified examples for **teaching purposes**.

➡️ Use this level to learn how to build more complex workflows and run them reproducibly with containers.
